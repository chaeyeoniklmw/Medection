# Pill Detection and Function Explanation System

## üöÄ Service Introduction
Our system is designed to assist individuals who are unfamiliar with their medication. By simply taking a picture of a pill packet, the system detects the type of medication and provides a detailed explanation of its function. Additionally, the system analyzes the combined functionality of the detected pills, offering insights into the overall treatment purpose.




### ‚ú® Features:
- **Pill Detection**: Automatically identify pills using state-of-the-art detection models.
- **Function Explanation**: Understand what each pill does and the purpose of the prescribed combination.
- **User Benefits**: Reduces the hassle of revisiting the hospital for a repeat prescription by tracking previously prescribed medications.

## üéØ Our Goal
- Compare **three cutting-edge object detection models**: YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet, to identify the best-performing model for pill detection.
- Achieve accurate detection of individual pills.
- Expand functionality to detect pill packets and infer their purpose in real-world settings.
